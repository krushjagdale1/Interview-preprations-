“Hi, my name is Ram, and I’m currently working as a DevOps Intern at Nimap Infotech LLP.

In my internship, I’ve worked with Git, Docker, Jenkins, and Linux. I’ve built Jenkins pipelines for automating builds and deployments, and used Docker to containerize applications. I also monitor systems using Prometheus and Grafana, and write shell scripts to automate daily tasks like server backups to AWS S3.

I really enjoy automating processes and solving real-world infrastructure problems. I’m now looking forward to growing as a DevOps Engineer in a company where I can work with cloud and AI-based technologies, and contribute to building efficient and reliable systems.
